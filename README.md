[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


Goal of this project is to detect lanes inside a video, using advanced image processing techniques such as color transformation, perspective transform (birds eye transform), gradients and thresholding, as well as advanced statistical techniques such as histogram analysis and polynomial fitting. Some techniques such as look-aside to recent lane detection was also performed to optimize performance.
